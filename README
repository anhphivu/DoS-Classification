# Introduction of intended use for code

The code, in the notebook main.ipynb, is used to perform pre-processing + analysis
with supervised learning techniques. It also outputs various useful plots.

# File structure and use of each file

project_group22.pdf: the report
main.ipynb: A Jupyter Notebook containing all code for pre-processing + supervised learning analysis + plotting.
main_copy.ipynb: a copy of main.ipynb in case you want to look at figures + plots while you verify that the code in main.ipynb works.

Folders for plots:
out_full/**: results of testing on full range of hyperparameters. These plots are generated for the report.
out_static/**: a frozen copy of out_full. This contains the plots that are included in the report PDF.
out_fast/**: results of testing on a limited range of hyperparameters. Some plots will not be useful e.g. comparing performance across hyperparameters in KNN.

# Instructions on how to run your code.

There is a full mode which takes longer to run than the fast mode.

Set full = True to test the entire range of hyperparameters to tune. 
This will take approx 14 minutes to run on Ed. 
Please keep the Ed window in the foregound to prevent it from sleeping. 
Around 10 minutes of this cost comes from tuning the optimum number of features 
by using top-k features mutual selection feature selection for each fold 
to prevent data leakage 
at the cost of longer computation time. 
That's (28-2+1) * 5 = 135 times that we attempt to select the top k MIs 
- with many more mutual information calculations than that!

Set full = False to only test a limited range of hyperparameters 
near the optimum that we have determined. 
This will take ~ 4 minutes to run on Ed.

After setting 'full' to the desired value, click 'Run All' to generate the plots.

# Any additional requirements needed to run code.
